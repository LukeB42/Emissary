# This script creates a named pipe (if it doesn't exist)
# and writes the feed name, article title and url to it
# whenever an article is saved to the database. 
#
# This is useful for composing systems that constantly read
# the FIFO and do things like emit the data to IRC channels.
#
# You could, for instance, perform fuzzy pattern matching and be
# notified when certain keywords are in the news.
#
# Transmission to a natural language processing/translation service
# can also be done in a script or by reading a FIFO like the one here.
#
# Whether you use this system to profit, perform intelligence analysis
# or inform your next vote is hopefully up to you!
